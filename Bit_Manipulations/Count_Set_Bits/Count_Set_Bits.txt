Count Set Bits. Design a function that counts the number of set bits (1s) in an integer without looping.

WTD: Given an integer, count the number of bits set to 1 in its binary representation. You need to achieve this without using any loops. Use bitwise operations to find the count efficiently.

(e.g.: I/P:  0b11010110; O/P: 5)
